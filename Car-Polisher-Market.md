The global market size for car polishers was valued at approximately $1.2 billion in 2023 and is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 5.1% from 2024 to 2032. This growth is fueled by various factors, including the proliferation of e-commerce platforms, which make it easier for consumers to access car polishing products.</p>        <p>Technological advancements also play a vital role in the market's evolution.
